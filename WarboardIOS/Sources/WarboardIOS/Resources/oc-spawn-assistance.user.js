//  CHANGELOG
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
// v3.1.70 — Banker-claim optimistic clear on vault-request Send. Hitting Send now POSTs to /api/oc/vault-request/:id/claim before opening the Controls tab. Server marks the request as claimed-by-this-banker and hides it from listRequests() for every viewer immediately, so all admins see it disappear without waiting for the 20s fundsnews poll → 15s client poll cycle (previously took ~3 manual refreshes to clear). If the matching fundsnews event arrives within the 90s claim TTL, the request is fully deleted as before. If the banker bails (closes Torn tab, never sends the money), the claim expires and the request reappears on every client's next list fetch — no orphaned requests. Two bankers clicking the same Send near-simultaneously: the second gets a 409 Conflict with "Already claimed by X" and their UI shows that message instead of removing the row.
// v3.1.69 — Scope DOM reader now rejects elements nested inside a completed-crime reward block. Torn's Completed tab shows per-OC "+N scope" chips (e.g. Pet Project +2 scope) whose wrapper class also contains the word "scope", so strategies 1 and 2 were scraping those per-OC rewards and pushing them as if they were the faction's current scope balance. That's the source of the 16 → 2 → 5 oscillation in v3.1.68's stability window logs. New insideCompletedContext() walks up ancestors and bails on any node whose className matches completed|executed|ended|reward|payout|result|history. Both strategy 1 (class-match) and strategy 2 (text-match) honor the guard.
// v3.1.68 — Scope stability window: Torn's React re-renders the scope badge during OC state transitions and the DOM class-match strategy sometimes catches intermediate values. Observed 04-24 05:00:24-05:00:41 EDT: 16 → 2 → 5 → 2 pushed in 20s, all class:container___THb7U scope_, when real scope was 16. Delay the commit + push by 2.5s; if a different value arrives inside the window, reset the timer and drop the transient. Legitimate scope changes settle well inside 2.5s so real edits feel ~live. Also moves CONFIG.SCOPE and GM_setValue inside the timer (previously they committed immediately; only the push was debounced).
// v3.1.67 — Fix Request button on vault-request form rendering as black text on a black background. The button was using class="w3b-btn" but that class never existed in the panel stylesheet — browsers fell back to UA default (which ends up ~invisible on the dark panel). Replaced with explicit inline styles matching the rest of the OC Spawn UI: green #2d6a4f background, white text, 1px green border, same padding/font-weight as Refresh.
// v3.1.66 — Drop the "= $X" preview line under the vault-request amount input. Now that the input live-translates "1k" → "1000" directly, the separate preview strip (v3.1.43) duplicates the same information and just adds noise. Removed the DOM element and the updatePreview() function; kept the input listener that does the translation.
// v3.1.65 — Vault-request amount input now live-translates shorthand. The moment the value ends in k/m/b and parses cleanly, the input text is overwritten with the expanded number — "1k" instantly becomes "1000", "10m" becomes "10000000". Works because people type the digits first and the suffix last, so by the time the k/m/b lands the digits are already fixed. The "1.5m" workflow still works: "1" → "1.5" stays as-is (no trailing suffix), and once the m arrives "1.5m" → "1500000" expands. v3.1.64's blur-only handler is replaced by this input-driven version.
// v3.1.64 — Vault-request amount input commits shorthand on blur. Previously typing "1m" showed a live "= $1,000,000" preview beside the input but the input itself stayed "1m". Now when the field loses focus we run parseVaultAmount and overwrite the input value with the expanded number ("1m" → "1000000"). Live preview is still shown during typing (important — so "1.5m" doesn't get clipped to "1000000" after the m keystroke). Only commits if the value contains k/m/b and parses successfully; plain numbers are untouched.
// v3.1.63 — Remove the dead vault-payout autofill path. The Send button's intent was to stash a {recipientId, amount} payload in sessionStorage and have a second listener on the Controls tab pre-fill Torn's give-to-user form via React input-setter hacks, but the selectors (input[name="money"], input[placeholder*="mount"]) haven't matched Torn's React DOM in a long time — autofill silently failed after a 10s poll, falling through to the clipboard-copy fallback that users actually see. Dead code removed (tryAutofillVaultPayout, setReactInputValue, maybeAutofill, hashchange listener). Send button now just copies the amount to clipboard and its <a> href handles the Controls-tab navigation. Status message updated from "Opening Controls tab — give X [id] $Y (autofill queued)" to "Amount copied. Paste into the Give form for X [id] — $Y" so it honestly describes what happens.
// v3.1.62 — Min CPR % setting description rewritten to explain what the threshold actually does in caller-facing terms: "Minimum checkpoint pass rate a member needs before the script considers them eligible to join a crime at their historical level. Anyone below this gets pinned to Lvl 1 only." Previous wording ("Below this, member defaults to Lvl 1 eligibility") was correct but required prior knowledge of what "defaults to Lvl 1" meant.
// v3.1.61 — Collapse the Notifications section of Settings into a single "Open Notifications Setup" button. Per-type toggles (Vault requests, OC ready to spawn) and the test button now live on the dedicated /notifications PWA page, which is the single source of truth for push preferences. Keeps the settings modal lean and works the same across desktop and PDA (PDA users get install-to-home-screen instructions on the page itself). Server whitelist (OC_PUSH_PREF_KEYS) and push-notifications.js NOTIFICATION_TYPES gain oc_ready_to_spawn (default: on) — the pref is stored now; the detection + broadcast side still needs to be wired, so toggling has no effect until that follow-up lands.
// v3.1.60 — Drop the PDA scheduleNotification polling loop; replace with a dedicated /notifications PWA page that partner factions install to their home screen. PDA's Flutter InAppWebView can't receive Web Push, but iOS 16.4+ Safari and Android Chrome can deliver Web Push to home-screen-installed PWAs — so the right answer is to give partners a proper PWA instead of trying to bridge PDA's native notification API. Server serves /notifications (with install-to-home-screen instructions, API-key login, Enable/Disable, vault-request pref toggle, Send test button) and /notifications/manifest.json (start_url: /notifications, short_name "OC Notif") so the installed icon launches straight into the flow. Previous /api/oc/push/pending endpoint + userscript polling infrastructure removed. Desktop Enable button now opens /notifications instead of /push/setup (which redirects for back-compat).
// v3.1.59 — PDA vault-request notifications via scheduleNotification. On Torn PDA (Flutter InAppWebView), the "Enable on This Device" button now toggles a client-side polling loop (30s interval) that hits the new GET /api/oc/push/pending endpoint for vault-request events created since the last bookmark, then fires each one as a local notification via window.flutter_inappwebview.callHandler('scheduleNotification', ...). Bookmark persists in GM storage so a page reload doesn't re-fire a backlog, and first-ever enable silently bookmarks "now" so enabling during a pending request doesn't spam the backlog either. Test button on PDA fires a local scheduleNotification directly (no server round-trip) so the user can verify the bridge works. ID range 700–799 rotated to avoid colliding with FactionOps' ranges. Desktop / mobile-web flow unchanged — they still hit /push/setup for the Web Push subscription.
// v3.1.58 — Enable-on-this-device fix for PDA: previous version opened tornwar.com/push/setup via GM_openInTab / window.open, which on Torn PDA's Flutter InAppWebView spawns a blank tab because Web Push isn't supported there at all (no Service Worker, no pushManager). Now detect PDA via window.flutter_inappwebview and show a yellow hint line directing the user to open the setup page in a desktop browser instead. Desktop / real mobile browsers still get the open-in-new-tab behavior unchanged. Push remains a per-device feature; PDA parity would need a PDA-native notifications path (scheduleNotification callHandler) which is out of scope for this change.
// v3.1.57 — Scope audit tag fix: _lastScopeDetectSource was initialized to the literal string 'auto', which short-circuited the `_lastScopeDetectSource || source || 'auto'` fallback chain inside pushScopeOnly. Result: every scope push logged on the server with source=auto, masking which strategy actually read the value (DOM state / class / text / AJAX XHR / AJAX Fetch). Initialize to null instead so the chain falls through to the caller's source arg (used by the AJAX interceptors) when no DOM read has landed a fresh value. Going forward the server audit log in pm2 will show specific tags like 'state', 'class:warScope', 'text:Scope … 1', or 'AJAX (XHR)' — makes the "where did that scope value come from?" question actually answerable.
// v3.1.56 — Vault-request notifications now work for partner factions that aren't running FactionOps. Added an "Enable on This Device" button next to "Send Test Notification" in Settings → Notifications. It opens tornwar.com/push/setup with the saved API key, which handles service-worker registration, VAPID fetch, and pushManager.subscribe on the tornwar.com origin, then POSTs to the new /api/oc/push/subscribe endpoint (auth'd by the same Torn API key used everywhere else). After enabling, the existing vault_request preference toggle + Send Test Notification flow work exactly as they did for FactionOps factions. Test-button error text updated to reference the Enable button instead of FactionOps.
// v3.1.38 — Outcome EV tables now include a Hit % column: empirical top-tier hit rate per scenario, computed from the faction's historical OC completions. We bucket by money payout since Torn doesn't label ending tiers directly — successful completions whose reward lands in the top quartile for that scenario count as top-tier hits. Lets admins compare predicted Top end % (tornprobability model) vs observed Hit % (faction's own history). Needs ≥4 successful completions to show a rate; otherwise displays '—' with the current sample count. Sortable like the other numeric columns.
// v3.1.37 — Empty-slot placeholder in Recruiting Outcome EV now uses the faction's avg CPR at each OC's difficulty level instead of the flat CPR-50. Average is computed client-side from cprCache across every member whose joinable/highestLevel reaches the OC's level, so the Recruiting numbers reflect "what-if-filled-by-an-average-one-of-us" instead of an artificially low floor. Planning panel unchanged (no empty slots to fill).
// v3.1.36 — Outcome EV table rows now link to the specific OC: the crime name is an anchor to /factions.php?step=your#/tab=crimes&crimeId=<id>, so "row with best Top end %" → one click → the exact OC in Torn's crimes list. Fill chip (e.g. 3/4) added next to each name so multiple same-named OCs at the same difficulty are distinguishable before clicking.
// v3.1.35 — Click-to-sort on Outcome EV tables: click any of the three numeric column headers (Pass %, Top end %, Q score) to rank OCs by that metric. Default sort is Top end % descending so the highest-payout slate is always on top once data lands. Click the same header twice to flip direction. Arrow (▼/▲) shows which column/direction is currently active. Rows still fetching stay anchored at the bottom of descending sorts. Info-icon (?) clicks continue to open tooltips without triggering a sort.
// v3.1.34 — Clickable info tooltips on Outcome EV column headers: click the ? next to Pass %, Top end %, or Q score for a short explanation of each metric. Reuses the existing CPR/scope tooltip pattern; tooltip closes on click-outside or second click on the same icon.
// v3.1.33 — Outcome EV now renders in BOTH tabs: Admin tab shows Recruiting OCs (so admins can see expected EV as slates fill), Engines tab keeps Planning OCs (locked slates, numbers reflect actual outcome). Both panels share the same /api/oc/outcome fetch path and 15-min server cache. Recruiting panel footer warns about CPR-50 neutral for empty slots; Planning panel has no caveat since every slot is filled.
// v3.1.32 — Outcome EV moved to Engines tab + repurposed the Slot Optimizer toggle. Previous v3.1.31 placement in the Admin tab is removed. The "Slot Optimizer" engine now renders as "Outcome EV" and shows per-OC Pass %, Top-end %, and Q score for OCs in Planning status (fully filled, waiting to launch or already running). No more CPR-50 fallback noise since every Planning slot has a real placed member. Legacy server toggle key eng-slot-optimizer reused so existing engine state persists; the server's old member-to-slot assignment payload is ignored client-side.
// v3.1.31 — Outcome EV analyzer (admin tab only): every recruiting OC gets a row with Pass %, Top-end %, and a weighted Q-score (goodEnding1=1.0, goodEnding2=0.7, goodEnding3=0.4, everything else=0.2). Data comes from a new server endpoint /api/oc/outcome that proxies tornprobability.com's CalculateSuccess with 15-min caching. Per-slot CPRs come from each placed member's byPosition history (fallback: overall CPR → 50 neutral for empty slots). Visibility: table renders inside the Admin tab, which is already role-gated, so rank-and-file members never see it. Server endpoint enforces the same role gate as defence-in-depth (403 for non-admins hitting it directly).
// v3.1.30 — MinCPR reset bug (and sibling settings): pushScopeOnly was hitting /api/oc/settings/update with only a `scope` query param, but that handler applied HARD-CODED defaults for every missing field — so every scope auto-detect tick silently reset mincpr → 60, cpr_boost → 15, active_days → 7, etc. Fixed on both sides: client pushScopeOnly now hits the dedicated /api/oc/scope endpoint, and /api/oc/settings/update now falls back to the stored value (not a constant) when a field is missing, so a partial push no longer clobbers untouched settings.
// v3.1.29 — Missing-items UX fix: after a successful loan the card now fades and collapses out of the list within ~1.4s, instead of sitting there with a ✓ Loaned button until the next full refresh (which was up to ~60s away on the API + armory cache cadence). The underlying filter via mgr_recentlyLoaned was already correct; only the visual feedback was lagging. If that was the last missing item, the "All OC items allocated" message takes its place without waiting for a full reload.
// v3.1.28 — Scope cleanup: auto-detect + auto-push is working correctly so dropped the verbose diagnostic logs (init snapshot, per-refresh overwrite decisions, strategy-fire lines). Kept the two useful console lines: "Detected scope change: X → Y (source: …)" and "pushed N to server". Strategy logs demoted to console.debug for Verbose-mode recovery if we ever need to diagnose again.
// v3.1.27 — Scope auto-push: when the DOM reader catches a fresh scope value (e.g. 14 from the Recruiting tab's currentScopes element), the script now debounce-pushes it to /api/oc/settings/update with the caller's API key, 1.5s debounce. Side effect: everyone else in the faction sees the fresh value on their next refresh — no one has to open the Recruiting tab themselves. Also makes the "revert to 11 on reload" class of bug impossible since the server's saved value matches the last detection.
// v3.1.26 — Scope diagnostic logging for "full reload reverts to 11": init now logs what GM storage contained at script boot (cfg_scope, cfg_scope_auto_ts, age in seconds, resulting CONFIG.SCOPE, autoDetected flag). fetchFactionSettings also logs whether it kept the fresh value or let the server overwrite, so we can tell exactly where a revert happens.
// v3.1.25 — Scope persistence: auto-detected scope now survives a full page reload. handleDetectedScope writes the value to GM_setValue('cfg_scope', …) and stamps GM_setValue('cfg_scope_auto_ts', now). On init, CONFIG._scopeAutoDetected is restored as true if that stamp is under 2h old, preventing fetchFactionSettings from clobbering the fresh detection with the stale server-saved value. Previously: reload → _scopeAutoDetected reset to false → server's 11 won even after user detected 14 on Recruiting.
// v3.1.24 — Scope diagnostics: upgraded the strategy-fired logs from console.debug to console.log so Chrome's default Console level shows them (Verbose was required to see debug). Detection log now includes the old→new transition so we can trace whether a strategy is actively overwriting a fresh value with a stale one vs. leaving it alone.
// v3.1.23 — ACTUAL scope root cause (turns out it was never the DOM reader): every runAnalysis refresh called fetchFactionSettings and unconditionally did CONFIG.SCOPE = srvSettings.scope, which overwrote a fresh auto-detected value (e.g. 14 from Recruiting DOM) with the last-saved server value (e.g. 11). Now only applies the server-side value when _scopeAutoDetected is false, so fresh local reads stick. The previous "scope goes back to 11 on Planning" wasn't a DOM-scrape issue — it was server-settings clobber. Strategies 0/1/2 kept as-is; 3.1.22's visibility gate + logs stay in place.
// v3.1.22 — Scope fix round 2: v3.1.21 removed fallback text-scraping entirely, but state (Strategy 0) apparently never populates on live Torn, so scope stopped updating altogether. Restored Strategies 1 (class-match) and 2 (text-match) but now gated on visibility — hidden tab panels (display:none, zero-size) are excluded, so Planning can't scrape stale 11 from an inactive Recruiting panel still sitting in the DOM. Each strategy now logs which fired + the element it matched so root-cause of any remaining mismatches is visible in devtools.
// v3.1.21 — Scope regression fix: DOM reader was overwriting a correct state-read value (e.g. 14 on Recruiting) with a stale DOM-text scrape from another tab (e.g. 11 on Planning from a tooltip/cached summary). Dropped the fallback text-scraping strategies entirely; scope now comes only from Torn's authoritative faction state (unsafeWindow.torn.faction.scope_balance). If state isn't populated on the current tab, last-known value stays put and the age chip indicates freshness.
// v3.1.20 — Scope source: Torn deleted the internal getCrimesData endpoint entirely ("Call to undefined method getCrimesData" on v3.1.19). Removed the HTTP refresh fetch; scope now comes exclusively from the DOM/state reader, which reads unsafeWindow.torn.faction.scope_balance from Torn's own state (populated whenever the user has loaded any factions page). Refresh button still nudges the reader in case a value is present but hasn't been picked up. Detection-age chip stays visible so stale readings are obvious.
// v3.1.19 — Scope fix: 3.1.18's direct getCrimesData call hit Torn's "Validation is required" wall because the internal endpoint requires an rfcv CSRF token (read from the rfc_v cookie). Added the token to the query string, matching the pattern used by the armory-cache fetches elsewhere in this script.
// v3.1.18 — Scope fix: v2 API dead-end — neither `basic` nor `crimes?cat=available` selections expose scope_balance (confirmed via shape dumps). Fell back to Torn's internal /factions.php?step=getCrimesData endpoint, same URL the crimes page uses internally. Called directly (not via the interceptor) with credentials:'include' + Accept:application/json. Logs the first 120 chars of the body when JSON.parse fails so we see exactly what Torn is returning.
// v3.1.17 — Scope fix: moved the refresh fetch from `/v2/faction?selections=basic` (which returns id/name/tag/respect/days_old/capacity — no scope) to `/v2/faction/crimes?cat=available` where scope_balance actually lives. Confirmed by 3.1.16's shape dump.
// v3.1.16 — Scope fix follow-up: 3.1.15's defensive lookup missed because Torn's `basic` selection wraps the payload one level deeper than checked. Replaced with a bounded recursive walk that finds any numeric field matching /scope/i at any depth. On miss, logs the full top-level shape so we can adapt without guesswork.
// v3.1.15 — Fix: scope wasn't refreshing. Old path fired at Torn's internal `step=getCrimesData` endpoint and relied on a sandbox AJAX interceptor to catch scope_balance — brittle because Torn's own XHRs happen in page context (bypass the wrapper) and sandbox-origin calls can get HTML responses that silently fail to parse as JSON. Now hits the documented v2 API via gmRequest with defensive field extraction + console.warn logging when the field isn't found.
// v3.1.14 — Fix: Admin tab was always visible to every member regardless of admin-roles list. Now hidden for non-admins alongside Manager/Metrics/Engines. Also removed the stale "Admin requires faction API access" locked message — gating is role-based now, the old copy was misleading.
// v3.1.13 — Admin settings (gear) now has a "Vault-Request Notifications" toggle and a "Send Test Notification" button. Toggle is server-backed via /api/oc/notification-prefs (auth'd by Torn API key — no FactionOps JWT needed). Test button fires a real push to the caller so they can verify their subscription before relying on live alerts.
// v3.1.12 — Vault-request amount input accepts shorthand: "500k" → 500,000, "2.5m" → 2,500,000, "1b" → 1,000,000,000. Also tolerates commas ("1,000"), leading $ ("$500"), and decimals. Input switched from type=number to type=text + inputmode=decimal so mobile still gets a numeric keypad.
// v3.1.11 — TornPDA fix: header buttons (Refresh, settings gear, close ✕) bind both click + touchend with a 350ms dedupe. Flutter InAppWebView swallows synthesized click events on children of the drag-handle <h2>, which is why taps in TornPDA did nothing. Handlers still fire exactly once on desktop / mobile web / WebView.
// v3.1.10 — Admin-roles config: in OC settings (gear), comma-separated faction positions that gate Admin/Manager/Engines tab visibility. Defaults to leader + co-leader. Replaces the API-key-tier check that was incorrectly granting tab access to anyone with a Limited+ key. Plus: $ button inside vault-request amount box auto-fills max balance; "Send anytime / Only when I'm online" is requester preference (push always goes to all admin-role members). "Send anytime / Only when I'm online" is now a requester preference about accepting money while offline (not notification filtering). Push notifications always go to everyone. Balance shown above form.
// v3.1.0 — Vault requests: My OC tab now shows a live "$X from vault" board. Any faction member submits an amount; Torn currencynews auto-removes the request when the transfer shows up. Push notifications on submit.
// v3.0.30 — Fix: Manager Delays tab used r.responseText, but gmRequest already returns { ok, status, data } with JSON parsed. That produced "JSON parse error: unexpected identifier undefined" every time. Now reads r.data and surfaces non-2xx responses with the server's error message.
// v3.0.29 — Feature: Delay tracking in OC history. Clients POST each flyer observation (crimeId, memberId, delayedSec) to /api/oc/flyer-delay (throttled per pair to 60s). Server keeps max delayedSec until the crime completes, then collectOcHistory bakes the value into the slot entry. New Manager → Delays sub-tab surfaces a 30-day leaderboard of who's held up the most OCs, total delay, longest single delay, and recent crimes; pending (in-flight) observations are included with a tag.
// v3.0.28 — Scope freshness: every Refresh now fires a call to Torn's internal getCrimesData endpoint to pull fresh scope_balance (existing AJAX interceptor catches the response and updates CONFIG.SCOPE). Scope strip also shows detection age next to "● live" — green under 1min, yellow 1-5min, red if older — so stale readings are visible instead of silent.
// v3.0.27 — Flyer alert "delayed Xm" label now ticks live (once per second) against Date.now() instead of freezing until the next Refresh. ready_at is fixed once Torn sets it, so no extra server/API load — purely client-side text update.
// v3.0.26 — Flyer alert urgency now shows how long the OC has been sitting ready ("delayed 47m", "delayed 1h12m") instead of a static "ready now" — a practical measure of how long the flyer is holding up the crew. Falls back to "ready now" only for Planning crimes where ready_at is null/0.
// v3.0.25 — Flyer names in the traveling-alert banner are now clickable: click a name to copy a preset fee-reminder ("You're holding off on the OC initiation...") to the clipboard and open the Torn compose page for that member, same UX as the eligible-members message button. Shared handler is attached to both the tooltip and the panel so either site fires it.
// v3.0.24 — Flyer alert now catches both "Traveling" (in-transit) and "Abroad" (landed overseas) — previously only Traveling fired, so members who'd already landed abroad were silently missed. Banner renamed to "flying" and shows each member's exact state.
// v3.0.23 — Traveling-alert only fires when the OC is truly "ready now" (not 30m out). Planning crimes with null/0 ready_at are treated as ready now (Torn V2 quirk); Recruiting crimes still need fully staffed + ready_at ≤ now.
// v3.0.34 — Remove confidence scoring + Bayesian shrinkage; trust raw CPR. Dev-only indicator now shows only sample count.
// v3.0.33 — Slot Optimizer engine toggle no longer force-reset to false on settings load; checkbox now persists.
// v3.0.32 — Confidence indicator shows info inline (stars + pct + samples) so it's readable on mobile without hover.
// v3.0.31 — Dev-only (XID 137558) confidence/samples indicator next to CPR values in Slot Optimizer output. Helps verify the server-side Bayesian CPR-tightening changes.
// v3.0.22 — Traveling-alert relaxed: Planning crimes always fire the flyer alert (ready_at in V2 is sometimes null/0 for Planning), and Recruiting crimes that are fully staffed + ready within 30m also fire. Urgency label now shows "ready in Nm" when not yet ready.
// v3.0.21 — Dispatcher shows "Subscribe to unlock" banner for non-subscribed factions
// v3.0.20 — Fix syntax error in dispatcher else-branch that broke entire script
// v3.0.17 — Skip new faction members (< 3 days) from eligible list with skip reason
// v3.0.16 — MutationObserver debouncing, shared crimes cache for Manager tab, loan button retry fix
// v3.0.15 — OC history collector fix: pull from completed crimes cache instead of active crimes
// v3.0.14 — Auto-Dispatcher defaults to enabled when not explicitly set in faction settings
// v3.0.13 — Remove spawn-key rate limiter
// v3.0.12 — Sync SCRIPT_VERSION to match @version header
// v3.0.11 — Reduced CPR boost threshold from 15% to 5% for more per-level consideration
// v3.0.10 — Disabled Slot Optimizer engine since Auto-Dispatcher serves similar purpose
// v3.0.9 — Removed hardcoded 15s refresh cooldown completely for faster button re-enable
// v3.0.8 — Reduced refresh cooldown from 15s to 3s for faster button re-enable
// v3.0.7 — Reduced retry delays (1s, 2s, 3s vs 5s, 10s, 20s) for faster refresh responsiveness
// v3.0.6 — Admin eligible list: prioritize OCs with most members filled, remove weight sorting
// v3.0.5 — fix: re-fetch data when navigating back to crimes tab (not just re-inject stale banner)
// v3.0.4 — travel alert: only show for fully staffed OCs (not partially filled ones with ready_at in past)
// v3.0.3 — dispatcher banner re-injects when navigating back to crimes tab
// v3.0.2 — dispatcher banner only visible on crimes tab, auto-hides on tab navigation
// v3.0.1 — auto-retry on fetch errors (3 retries w/ backoff), dispatcher banner shows retry/error state
// v3.0.0 — 6 engines: Slot Optimizer, Failure Risk, CPR Forecaster, Member Projector, Member Reliability, Auto-Dispatcher
// v2.7.1 — Remove scoring breakdown; add "Join" link on each fallback option
// v2.7.0 — Dispatcher shows actual execution countdown from Torn API (ready_at) instead of estimated time
// v2.6.9 — Hide negative hoursToExpiry in dispatcher banner (expired_at can be in the past for active crimes)
// v2.6.8 — Dispatcher banner always visible: loading spinner on init, status messages when no data or in OC
// v2.6.7 — Panel no longer auto-opens; stays closed until user clicks the toggle button (respects oc_panel_closed flag)
// v2.6.6 — Dispatcher banner: click navigates via hash URL (#crimeId=...) so Torn's own router expands the card; fallbacks also clickable
// v2.6.5 — Dispatcher banner: show OC name and position in recommendation
// v2.6.4 — Dispatcher auto-refresh on new data without manual click
// v2.6.3 — Dispatcher fallback: show top 3 alternative OCs if primary is full

// v2.6.0 — Auto-Dispatcher engine: real-time OC recommendations on crimes page
// v2.5.3 — Expiry Risk engine: flag OCs expiring within configurable window
// v2.5.2 — Gap Analyzer engine: identify role/level shortages in faction
// v2.5.1 — Item ROI engine: track armory item costs vs OC payout returns
// v2.5.0 — OC Payout Tracker engine: payout per hour across OC types
